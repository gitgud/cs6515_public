This repo primarily deal with format and highlights things that will lose marks on assignments. 

It absolutely will not help you solve any problems. The exception is the fourier series stuff, that file actually has to do with figuring out concepts.

Anybody taking the class or has in the past is welcome to contribute to the repo. I do ask that you provide proof of your claims whenever possible and cite them. Examples of proof can be found in the proof folder. 
The naming convention for proof files is Topic-itemId-term-titleOfFile. I also do ask you black out any names and material that gives away anything more than format issues.

This includes:
-Specific algo names used in your solution
-Anything related to strategy of solving a HW problem
-Pre and post conditions of input/output
-An example of an acceptable screenshot can be found in proof/DC-1-24
